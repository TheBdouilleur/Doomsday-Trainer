# Doomsday-Trainer
Train your mental abilities and impress your friend by learning to use the [Doomsday Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule)!
This simple and fast set of rules will let you calculate the day on which any date fell!  Currently with CLI, but a GUI is in early stage.

## Installation
### Source code
If you choose to use the source code as-is, simply unzip/clone the repository and make `background.pyw` as a startup script.
The only dependency is Python 3.

### Binaries
Alternatively, you can download the binaries from this folder (currently only on Windows), and make `trainer.exe` as a startup script.

## Usage
The program will ask you a date at login and every hour; your answer time is measured and logged in `average.log`, and a data analyser is under development.  Good training!
